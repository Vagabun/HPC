implemantation of AVL-tree (balanced binary search tree) for any data type in C.

user should provide his own compare, allocate (two separate functions - one is for insert data into tree and second is for copy data between nodes), print and delete functions for his data type.

compare function for user data type should always return `-1` for `==` case, `1` for `>` case and `0` otherwise.
